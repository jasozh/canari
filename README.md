# Canari
Canari is a GTK4/libadwaita application for tracking the enrollment status of Cornell classes. Requests are automatically sent to Class Roster every 10 minutes, and changes are immediately communicated through native desktop notifications. If you need to add a class and want a native Linux solution, this is the app for you.

## Installation
Canari is provided as a Flatpak. Visit https://flatpak.org/setup/ to set up Flatpak on your Linux distro, then go to `Releases` and download the flatpak file. Canari can then be installed either via the command line with `flatpak install <file>` or by GUI software centers supporting Flatpak files.

Unfortunately, there are currently no plans to host a Flatpak repository. You can check this page periodically to download new releases.

## Building
The recommended way to build Canari is through GNOME Builder. Visit the guide https://wiki.gnome.org/Newcomers/BuildProject to get started.
